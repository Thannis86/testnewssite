      "GENEVA, SWITZERLAND—World Health Organization officials expressed
      disappointment Monday at the group’s finding that, despite the enormous
      efforts of doctors, rescue workers and other medical professionals
      worldwide, the global death rate remains constant at 100 percent.""

      "Death, a metabolic affliction causing total shutdown of all life
      functions, has long been considered humanity’s number one health concern.
      Responsible for 100 percent of all recorded fatalities worldwide, the
      condition has no cure. “I was really hoping, what with all those new
      radiology treatments, rescue helicopters, aerobics TV shows and what have
      you, that we might at least make a dent in it this year,” WHO Director
      General Dr. Gernst Bladt said. “Unfortunately, it would appear that the
      death rate remains constant and total, as it has inviolably since the dawn
      of time.” Many are suggesting that the high mortality rate represents a
      massive failure on the part of the planet’s health care workers. “The
      inability of doctors and scientists to adequately address this issue of
      death is nothing less than a scandal,” concerned parent Marcia Gretto
      said. “Do you have any idea what a full-blown case of death looks like?
      Well, I do, and believe me, it’s not pretty. In prolonged cases, total
      decomposition of the corpse is the result.” “What about the children?” the
      visibly moved Gretto added. “At this early date, I don’t want to start
      making broad generalizations,” Citizens for Safety’s Robert Hemmlin said,
      “but it is beginning to seem possible that birth—as well as the subsequent
      life cycle that follows it—may be a serious safety risk for all those
      involved.” Death, experts say, affects not only the dead, but the non-dead
      as well.""
